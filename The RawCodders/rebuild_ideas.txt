  Mountain Rescue HQ - App Rebuild Ideas
========================================================

1. REAL-TIME INCIDENT MAP
   - Integrate a map component (e.g., Leaflet or Mapbox) on the dashboard
   - Display active incidents as pins using gpsCoordinates
   - Color-code pins by severity level (1=green, 5=red)
   - Show weather conditions as overlays
   - Click on a pin to see incident details and dispatched resources

2. LIVE DISPATCH BOARD
   - Create a Kanban-style board for incident management
   - Columns: Standby → Active → Resolved
   - Drag-and-drop dispatches between incident stages
   - Real-time updates when status changes (leveraging Convex subscriptions)

3. PERSONNEL AVAILABILITY DASHBOARD
   - Live roster showing who is available, on-mission, or off-duty
   - Shift scheduling component with drag-and-drop
   - Certification expiry alerts and renewal tracking
   - Auto-suggest best-fit personnel for new incidents based on certifications and proximity

4. EQUIPMENT LIFECYCLE TRACKER
   - Visual timeline of each equipment item's lifecycle
   - Automated maintenance reminders based on lastInspected date
   - QR code scanning for quick equipment status updates in the field
   - Integration with inventory management for consumables (first aid supplies, batteries, etc.)

5. WEATHER INTEGRATION
   - Pull real-time weather data from API (OpenWeatherMap, etc.)
   - Auto-populate weatherConditions when creating new incidents
   - Weather alerts for base stations (avalanche warnings, storm forecasts)
   - Historical weather correlation with incident frequency

6. AI-POWERED INSIGHTS (Enhanced)
   - Predict high-risk periods based on historical incident data and weather patterns
   - Personnel workload balancing recommendations
   - Equipment failure prediction based on maintenance logs
   - Mission debrief summaries auto-generated from mission_reports
   - Training gap analysis based on incident difficulty vs. certifications

7. MOBILE-FIRST FIELD APP
   - PWA (Progressive Web App) for field responders
   - Offline capability for areas with no signal
   - GPS auto-detection for incident reporting
   - Push notifications for new dispatches
   - Quick status updates (one-tap "arrived on scene", "patient secured", etc.)

8. COMMUNICATION HUB
   - In-app messaging between dispatched personnel
   - Integration with radio/satellite communication logs
   - Automated status broadcast to all team members during active incidents
   - Emergency SOS button with auto-location sharing

9. REPORTING & ANALYTICS
   - Monthly/quarterly mission summary reports (PDF export)
   - Response time analytics (dispatch to arrival)
   - Incident type distribution charts (already partially implemented)
   - Personnel performance metrics
   - Equipment utilization rates
   - Severity trend analysis over time

10. TRAINING & CERTIFICATION MODULE
    - Track certification expiry dates with automated reminders
    - Training session scheduling and attendance tracking
    - Skill assessment records
    - Required certifications per incident type mapping

11. MULTI-BASE STATION SUPPORT
    - Separate dashboards per base station
    - Cross-station resource sharing requests
    - Hierarchical coordination (regional → base station → team)
    - Inter-station dispatch capability

12. INCIDENT TIMELINE
    - Detailed timeline view for each incident
    - Log every action: dispatch, arrival, status change, medical interventions
    - Attach photos and notes at each timeline point
    - Exportable incident report for official documentation

13. INTEGRATION IDEAS
    - Hospital notification system for incoming patients
    - Helicopter/air ambulance dispatch integration
    - National park visitor registration cross-reference
    - Emergency services (police, fire) coordination API
    - Terrain/elevation data integration for route planning

14. DATA MIGRATION STRATEGY
    - Create migration scripts from old schema (products/clients/etc.) to new schema
    - Map old seed data patterns to new mountain rescue context
    - Preserve the AI insights pipeline but retrain for rescue operations metrics
    - Keep the existing auth system intact

15. UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
    - Dark mode optimized for field use (less eye strain at night)
    - High-contrast mode for harsh sunlight conditions
    - Larger touch targets for gloved operation
    - Voice command integration for hands-free operation
    - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
